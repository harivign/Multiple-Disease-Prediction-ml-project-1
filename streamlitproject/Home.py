**Empowering Early Detection for Better Health Outcomes**
         
Health is wealth, and timely detection of diseases can save lives. Our Multiple Disease Prediction System leverages cutting-edge machine learning techniques to provide accurate, data-driven predictions for multiple health conditions. Designed with care and precision, this platform focuses on three critical diseases:

**Parkinson’s Disease**: A neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and coordination.\n
**Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**: A condition where kidneys lose their ability to filter blood efficiently.\n
**Indian Liver Patients (ILPD)**: A comprehensive approach to detecting liver disorders common in the Indian population.
